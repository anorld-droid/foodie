# foodie
A mobile application that allows customers to browse, order, and pay for products conveniently. The walkout store features QR codes on food items for quick and seamless checkout.

To revolutionize the food industry where access to healthy and sustainable food is not a luxury, but a fundamental right. We envision a future where organic food is the norm, and everyone has easy access to it through our mobile application and walkout stores. We aim to inspire and empower individuals to make healthier choices for themselves, creating a sustainable and thriving food ecosystem.
